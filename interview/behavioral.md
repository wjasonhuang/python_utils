# Leadership:
Be prepared to discuss how you have used your communication and decision-making skills to mobilize others. This might be by stepping up to a leadership role at work or with an organization, or by helping a team succeed even when you weren’t officially the leader.

# Googleyness:
Share how you work individually and on a team, how you help others, how you navigate ambiguity, and how you push yourself to grow outside of your comfort zone.

# General tips for success:
- Listen carefully. Rephrasing questions or asking for clarity is okay, as is telling the interviewer you want time to collect your thoughts .
- Be concise. Make sure you’re answering the question and not using a prepared example that isn’t applicable or related to the questions.
- Think in terms of examples that will showcase your top selling points.
- Don’t worry about giving the right answer. The interviewer will be looking to see the thought process versus the answer itself. Expect follow-up questions.
- Come prepared with thoughtful questions (e.g., team priorities, culture, etc.). Interviewing is a two-way street, so we want you to feel comfortable and understand how a role at Google could help you grow your career.

# Questions:
Describe two specific goals you set for yourself and how successful you were in meeting them. What factors led to your success?
- Your objectives—be clear on those up front.
- Reasons you chose those particular goals.
- Any measures you set up to track progress.
- Obstacles you overcome and things learned along the way.

Tell me about a time when you failed to meet a deadline. What did you fail to do? What did you learn?
- The root cause.
- How you applied what you learned in future projects.

Imagine you are in charge of organizing the grand opening of a new Google office in Bangalore, India. What steps would you take to plan this event?
- The objective of the event, and measurement of success.
- Who will be invited to the event.
- Logistics around the event, set-up, location, timing.
- Stakeholders to involve in the process.

1. How would you handle organizing a team building event for your team?
2. If you planned to ship a product and you did a big demo right before this shipment, but you find a crash hours before, how would you go about it?
3. Talk about one of the hardest challenges you've had in your life? Could be software related or not.
