# Leadership:
Be prepared to discuss how you have used your communication and decision-making skills to mobilize others. This might be by stepping up to a leadership role at work or with an organization, or by helping a team succeed even when you weren’t officially the leader.

# Googleyness:
Share how you work individually and on a team, how you help others, how you navigate ambiguity, and how you push yourself to grow outside of your comfort zone.

# General tips for success:
- Listen carefully. Rephrasing questions or asking for clarity is okay, as is telling the interviewer you want time to collect your thoughts .
- Be concise. Make sure you’re answering the question and not using a prepared example that isn’t applicable or related to the questions.
- Think in terms of examples that will showcase your top selling points.
- Don’t worry about giving the right answer. The interviewer will be looking to see the thought process versus the answer itself. Expect follow-up questions.
- Come prepared with thoughtful questions (e.g., team priorities, culture, etc.). Interviewing is a two-way street, so we want you to feel comfortable and understand how a role at Google could help you grow your career.

# Questions:
Describe two specific goals you set for yourself and how successful you were in meeting them. What factors led to your success?
- Your objectives—be clear on those up front.

1. How would you handle organizing a team building event for your team?
2. If you planned to ship a product and you did a big demo right before this shipment, but you find a crash hours before, how would you go about it?
3. I was asked about my past leadership roles, how I meet my deadlines, how I would lead a team etc. The interviewer built up questions from my responses itself.
4. Have you been on a situtation where a member of your team had a bad actitude or a negative actitude? How do you managed it or solve it?
5. Does your boss have asked you something that is unreasonable? If that is the case, do you point it out when he asked that to you?, or do you wait to tell that the request is not possible?
6. Have you ever been on a situtation in which you don't agree with the rest of your team members?, How do you solve it?
