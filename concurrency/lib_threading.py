https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#with-locks
Objects that have acquire() and release() methods can be used as context managers for a with statement.
The acquire() method will be called when the block is entered.
The release() will be called when the block is exited.

class threading.Semaphore(value=1)
    The optional argument gives the initial value for the internal counter; it defaults to 1. 
    acquire(blocking=True, timeout=None)
        * If the internal counter is larger than zero on entry, decrement it by one.
        * If the internal counter is zero on entry, block until awoken by a call to release().
    release()
        * Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.
        * When it was zero on entry and another thread is waiting, wake up that thread.

class threading.BoundedSemaphore(value=1)
    A bounded semaphore checks to make sure its current value doesnâ€™t exceed its initial value.
    If it does, ValueError is raised.
