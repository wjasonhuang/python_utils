class threading.Lock
    acquire(blocking=True, timeout=-1)
    * Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.
    
    release()
    * Release a lock. This can be called from any thread, not only the thread which has acquired the lock.


class threading.Semaphore(value=1)
    The optional argument gives the initial value for the internal counter; it defaults to 1. 

    acquire(blocking=True, timeout=None)
    * If the internal counter is larger than zero on entry, decrement it by one.
    * If the internal counter is zero on entry, block until awoken by a call to release().
    
    release()
    * Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.
    * When it was zero on entry and another thread is waiting, wake up that thread.


class threading.BoundedSemaphore(value=1)
    A bounded semaphore checks to make sure its current value doesnâ€™t exceed its initial value.
    If it does, ValueError is raised.


class threading.Condition(lock=None)
    acquire(*args)
    
    release()
    
    wait(timeout=None)
    
    wait_for(predicate, timeout=None)
    * Wait until a condition evaluates to true.
    * predicate should be a callable which result will be interpreted as a boolean value. 
    
    notify(n=1)
    * By default, wake up one thread waiting on this condition, if any.
    
    notify_all()
    * Wake up all threads waiting on this condition.


https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#with-locks
Objects that have acquire() and release() methods can be used as context managers for a with statement.
The acquire() method will be called when the block is entered.
The release() will be called when the block is exited.
